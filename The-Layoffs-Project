Layoffs Project (2020-2023): Understanding the Factors Influencing Workforce Reductions

Overview

This project examines layoffs across various industries, countries, and companies from 2020 to early 2023. The dataset provides insights into the complex factors contributing to workforce reductions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic and business factors.

Dataset

- Source: This datset is originally from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022, but accessed through AlexTheAnalyst's GitHub repository: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv
- Timeframe: January 2020 - March 2023 (data collection cutoff)
- Industries: Data, finance, healthcare, transportation, consumer, education etc.
- Countries: United States, Brazil, Canada, Nigeria, Germany, Denmark etc. 

- Variables:
    - Company name
    - Industry
    - Total_laid_off
    - Layoff date
    - Country
    - Stage
    - Funds_raised_millions
    - Percentage_laid_off

Context

The dataset spans a period marked by significant economic disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely contributed to layoffs in 2020. However, other factors such as company-specific challenges, industry trends, and macroeconomic conditions may have also played a role in workforce reductions.

Data Cleaning

The dataset underwent extensive cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. Steps included:

- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing the data
- Standardizing date formats
- Data normalization
- Taking out null or blank values
- Removing any unnecessary columns and rows 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The cleaned dataset was analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and correlations. Key findings include:

- Various industries ranging from food, finance, retail, consumer etc. accounted for majority of layoffs (100%)
- The United States experienced the highest number of layoffs
- Large companies (>10,000 employees) accounted for 50% of total layoffs

These findings suggest that these various industries and large companies were disproportionately affected by layoffs. Further analysis can be necessarily taken to understand the underlying causes and potential implications.

Usage

This dataset can be used for:

- Analyzing industry-specific layoff trends
- Investigating geographical differences in layoffs
- Identifying companies with significant layoffs
- Examining the interplay between economic factors and workforce reductions
